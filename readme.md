# ADB File Explorer
Needed a simple way to get files from my Android Phone to my Mac.

As there is no native way to browse or load from Android devices on a Mac i was looking up multiple solutions, which non of where anyhow practicable or pretty unstable. \
I asked myself why not use adb for it? And here it is.

### Make sure you have ADB installed
